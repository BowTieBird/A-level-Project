# A-level Project: Assembly Language Code Builder & LMC

This project was created using Processing (https://processing.org/).

If you wish to view the code, the .pde files may be opened in a text editor.

If you wish to edit the code and run the project, you must download processing from the above link.

If you wish to simply run the program, download the folder 'Exe' which contains the application. Note that you need to have java installed (https://java.com/en/download/).

Once you have it running, here are some ways to get started:
  *  Click on the purple help (?) icon to learn what each of the menu options and components do
  *  Click on the yellow load (file) icon, then type in 'fibonacci-1' and press enter. This will load an example program which you can compile (blue arrow) and run (green arrow).
